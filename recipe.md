In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg, and melted butter mix until the batter get smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium-high heat.
Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.
Wait until it get brown and then flip it and make it brown from another side also.
And Boom! your pancakes are ready.
Put little cube of butter on the top of the pancakes and serve them hot.
